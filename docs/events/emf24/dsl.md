# DSL

We are hoping to operate ADSL and VDSL2 services in a limited trial area located in the North-East of the site around [DKC2](https://map.emfcamp.org/#19.16/52.0430086/-2.3742415/B,N,P,St,V/m=52.043128,-2.373852)

If you can't camp in this area but which to play with VDSL, you're welcome to drop by the ECHQ Village

**Note:** This is a _trial_ and might not come to fruition.

## Equipment
 
 - Lots of CAT5 or twisted pair cable, up to 100m. Terminated with CAT5 as per the [wiring diagram](../../technical/wiring.md))
 - A router or modem that supports ADSL2 or VDSL2. You _must_ be able to disable the WiFi functionality on it, ideally prior to EMF.
