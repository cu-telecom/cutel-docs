# Telephones

Once you have [activated](getting_started.md#activating-your-line) your line you should be able to make and receive calls to other POTs and DECT users as well as applications.

## Features

### Dialling 
Loop Disconnect (LD) or Pulse Dialling is supported during call setup but not mid-call i.e An LD phone can dial out, but cannot interact with IVRs or other services that require you to press a button. It might be useful to have an MF/DTMF telephone handy.

### Caller ID
Called ID is enabled by default but uses "Bellcore" rather than the standard used by British Telecom. Most Caller-ID enabled phones should still show the number.

### Ringing
Lines are limited to 2 REN and should provide enough ringing current to ring the bells on a converted retro telephone with the 3.3k resistor fitted in series with the bell.

Note that many phones require a "Ring Capacitor" which isn't always found in adapters or telephone sockets. Look out for ones the mention "Master", "PABX" or "PBX" in the name. Or buy a compatible one from the ECHQ village.
