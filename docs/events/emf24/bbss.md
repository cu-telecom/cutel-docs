# BBSs

You can access several Bulletin Boards from the CuTEL Network.  

If you intend to host your own BBS on a CuTEL line, please get in touch so we can optimise your line.

## EMF BBS

EMF BBS is a (very) basic BBS that allows you to chat with other users and check the weather. The chat's bridged to #cutel on Libera.chat and the #irc-relay channel on the [CuTEL Discord Server](https://discord.gg/aSNTDwzvAR).

### Connecting

* **Modem** - 903931
* **Telnet** - bbs.cutel.net:23
* **IRC** - If you want to join the fun but don't want to connect directly to the BBS or run an IRC client, you can use the [web client](https://web.libera.chat/gamja/#cutel)

## Magnum BBS

For a more complete BBS experience try [Magnum](https://bbs.magnum.uk.net/) which features Chat, Messaging and Games! Magnum is one of the best UK Bulletin Boards going and the Sysop known as Keyop does a great job of operating it.
