## Wiring Diagrams

If you want to make your own cables, sockets, or Network Termination Equipment, refer to the diagram below. 

 - For a single line you just need to connect pins 4 & 5
 - For a trunk you will need to connect all the pins
 - Note that the wiring scheme is T568A, however you can use the more common T568B - it's only the pinout that matters
