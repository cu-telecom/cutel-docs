# Telemessage

Telemessage is an innovative new service brought to you by CuTEL in partnership with the EMF Sneakernet team that allows you to send  messages via your fax machine for delivery via mail and likewise allows someone to place a message in a Sneakernet post box for delivery via fax. 

## Sending a Telemessage via a Fax Machine

  1. Call TODO from your fax machine to receive a Telemessage template, or grab a piece of paper
  2. Write who or where the message should be sent to. This would normally be a village name, location, or otherwise identifiable description. Including things like a DECT number can be helpful
  3. Write who the message is from. Remember to include your name, village, and fax / DECT number
  4. Send the fax to TODO
  5. Your Telemessage will then be delivered by the Sneakernet team
