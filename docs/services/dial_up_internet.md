# Dial Up Internet

We provide Dial Up Internet access - up to a blazing 56kb/s.

## Equipment

You will need a modem to connect to Dial Up. We recommend a _real_ modem such as those made by US Robotics, rather than a [winmodem/softmodem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmodem)

If you intend to host your own Dial Up service on a CuTEL line, please see the technical page for [modems](../technical/modems.md)
